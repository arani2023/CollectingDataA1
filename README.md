# Digital Humanities Tools & Methods - Assignment 1 

## The Topic
Museums have always been spaces where ideas, creativity, and innovation are not only preserved but also ignited (Boyd, 1999). In major cities around the world, museums have become central to their identity, from The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam, to the ArtScience Museum in Singapore. Continuously, museums are becoming places where people of all ages learn and experience new horizons. However, a journal by William Boyd, “Museums as Centers of Controversy”, can provide a reflective lens to examine whether museums have exhibited any biases in their collections and exhibitions. 

## Research Questions
Is Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York has been biased in presenting their collections? How diverse is the representation of artists in terms of gender and ethnicity in MoMA's exhibitions? Has MoMA's strategy evolved over time to include a broader range of artistic styles and origins?

Exploration of these research questions can be conducted by delving into museum archives and datasets to analyze the representation of different artists based on gender, ethnicity, and geographical origin. Furthermore, reviewing previous journals and articles related to the topic of museum bias could be beneficial to enrich perspectives on the matter.

## Data Requirement
Dataset of exhibition records that include names of artists, name of artwork, country of origin, ethnicity, gender, and date of published. 

## Tools & Methods
Text analysis tools and data visualization.
